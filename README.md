# 👋 Hi, I'm Michal

💡 With a solid background in data and technology since **2015**, I specialize in designing and optimizing data-driven solutions.  
Currently working as a **Business Intelligence Solutions Architect**, I’ve also worked as a **Data Engineer**, **SQL & ETL Developer**, **Data Analyst**, and **BI Project & Team Lead**.  
In recent years, my focus has expanded to **Machine Learning**, with a strong emphasis on **Computer Vision** — including **image processing**, **deep learning models**, and **automation of visual data analysis**.  
I’m based in **Warsaw, Poland**.

🎓 I hold a **B.Sc. in Biomedical Engineering** (specialization in *Medical Informatics*) and an **M.Sc. in Computer Science** (specialization in *Software Engineering*) from Bialystok University of Technology.  
Additionally, I completed **Postgraduate Studies in Business Intelligence** at SGH Warsaw School of Economics.
